## Overview
This is my second challenge from [Frontend Mentor](frontendmentor.io).
This is a really good challenge for beginners to test their knowledge of HTML and CSS.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
